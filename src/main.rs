//!
//! Main Program for Z80 CPU Emulator in Rust
//!
//! This module serves as the entry point for the Z80 CPU emulator. It will eventually contain
//! the logic to load Z80 programs (e.g., from a ROM file), initialize the CPU and memory,
//! and run the emulation loop. Test cases have been moved to `tests/cpu_tests.rs` for
//! verification of CPU functionality.
//!
//! Key Features (Planned):
//! - Load and execute Z80 programs from files
//! - Interactive I/O handling
//! - Configurable memory and device setups
//!
//! Dependencies:
//! - `z80_cpu.rs`: Provides the `Z80` CPU implementation and related structs/traits
//! - `memory.rs`: Provides the `SimpleMemory` implementation
//!
//! Usage:
//! Run with `cargo run` to start the emulator. Use `cargo test` to execute integration tests.
//!
